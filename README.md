# Bus Management System
This desktop application was created as part of the course 'Programming in Java' and is made with JavaFX.
The purpose of the application is to facilitate the purchase of a ticket for a wanted route. 

For the user, the access to ticket purchase has been simplified by obtaining a selection of buses, all routes and the reservation of a specific seat in the selected bus.

In addition to all benefits of the end user, the administrator has the ability to view statistics (number of registrations, buses and routes), and to add, delete or edit users, buses and routes.
